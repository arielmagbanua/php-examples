# About This Project

It is a simple set up and configuration for firestore usage in laravel.

## Get started with Cloud Firestore

To [set up your development environment](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#php), you have to generate first your service account key file and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to that JSON key file,
install and enable gRPC extension for PHP, and add the Cloud Firestore PHP library to your app (run `composer require google/cloud-firestore`).
